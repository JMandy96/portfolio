                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <strong><small>dedicated, hard-worker looking to break in to 
                    the tech industry.</small></strong>
                <p>I am looking to have a continuous education to get myself 
                    into a new industry to build a better life for myself and 
                    my future family, previously having experience in the food 
                    industry I picked up on being able to hustle and get work 
                    done in a timely manner. That experience translted well 
                    for me when I moved into working production in factory 
                    jobs, there I was able to work my way up into 
                    higher positions. I moved up in the industry to end up 
                    as a process technician where i would have to solve 
                    how to get material to fill out and make a new part 
                    for future runs, solving how to make production parts 
                    meet the standards of our customers.

                <h1>Why I got into coding: </h1>
                <strong><small>This is not a picture of me or anything yet, 
                    it is currently a cat. I am not a cat.

                <p>I have always had an interest in learning how to start
                    coding as I have always been using computers often for my
                    entire life, but every time I got interested I would begin 
                    with searching what sources to learn from, or what languages 
                    tostart with, getting several different results of where to
                    start or others saying not to start there it would always
                    cause me to get very overwhelmed with where to begin. 
                    <br><br>
                    Recently, a friend of mine pointed me into the direction
                    of taking a bootcamp course as he knew several people who 
                    have taken one and became successful in the tech industry 
                    from doing so, so I asked him for a few he knew of and did
                    my research and eventually decided the best option for me
                    was getting into the Coding Temple software Engineering
                    bootcamp. I am hoping this will help me in getting myself
                    a better work/life balance as well as getting out of doing
                    work thats damaging my body from the physical labor I do as
                    well as getting away from breathin in fumes from melted
                    plastics all day long.

                <h1>Job Experience</h1>
                <strong>Chicken Shack:<small>Cook/cashier</small></strong>
                <p>My first job where I learned to move quickly to keep the
                     place clean while managing to get food orders, on top of
                      that I also managed to get experience working the 
                      register to experience working with customers.</p>

                <strong>Buffalo Wild Wings: <small>Window/trainer</small></strong>
                <p>Following my first job I moved on to another restraunt job 
                    where ended up getting experience training new employees 
                    on how to do the job as well as managing the kitchen to 
                    be able to organize orders for the servers in a way that 
                    the food would go out at the right customers and keep 
                    kitchen staff on track to call out what was needed and 
                    when so that the food would go out fresh.</p>
                <strong>Century Plastics(CIE):<small>production 
                    operator/material handling/mold setting</small></strong>
                <p>Here I managed to start in a new industry as well as move 
                    my way up by being a thorough operator and impressing my 
                    employers by being able to pick up on how to do other jobs 
                    without needing to be taught but just by watching others 
                    while i did the job i was assigned, eventually just 
                    being able to start doing things on my own without having 
                    to call anyone over to start up machines. Upon seeing this
                    my employers gave me an oportunity to learn more about 
                    the machines by changing them out, filling up materials 
                    needed to keep them running as well as even working doing 
                    maintenance to keep things running without issues.</p>

                <strong>MISC Products:<small>Operator</small></strong>
                <p>MISC experience had me multitasking working multiple 
                    machines at once to keep up with production on a shift 
                    that had less staffing, and still was awarded with having 
                    top quality production of my shift.</p>

                <strong> Elite Mold and Engineering:<small>material 
                    handling/ process tech</small></strong>
                <p>Coming here was from the company having issues with 
                    oranization from having a period of no one working 
                    the material handling position, I came in, got everything 
                    caught back up in that department and getting the 
                    warehouse organized more properly, as well as learning the 
                    computer system to keep detailed records of where 
                    everything was located. Upon getting things caught 
                    up and getting free time i started to change out the 
                    moulds in the machines to prepare things for the next job 
                    run, and eventually was able to have things in a place 
                    where the material handling job could be 
                    passed on to a newer employee and trained someone fresh 
                    out of highschool to do the job, which freed me up to be 
                    able to go on to learn how to process the new jobs to get 
                    going on brand new jobs that were coming into the shop and 
                    getting an understand of how the machines work to allow 
                    plastics to into the moulds that were being made so that 
                    the part would come out to the customer standards and 
                    without damaging the parts or the moulds they came out of, 
                    knowing  the parts would be completely full and durable 
                    when sent out.
